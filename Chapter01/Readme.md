# Chapter 1

## Overview
In this chapter, we will see how to create: 

* Azure VMs
* Azure File Shares
* Azure Queues
* Azure Tables


## Steps:
1. Install the Azure command line tool on your computer or directly open the Azure web command line tool and run the commands there.
2. You can find instructions to install Azure CLI here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli
3. You can also choose to run the commands directly on the Azure Cloud Shell. Refer here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart
2. Start with the AzureCloudShell.ps1 script first. Enter your Azure details in that script and either execute the script manually or just run the complete script from the command line.
3. Try each of the other scripts and explore the options available with each of the commands.

## Azure CLI
After installing Azure CLI on your computer, start a Windows PowerShell terminal and run the following command to log into Azure.
```
az login
```
This should take you to a browser where you can log in to Azure.
Once logged in, start from the AzureCloudShell.ps1 script in this directory.
